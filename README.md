### Adding testcases to group project
  I have worked with the create event function, for which I added the corresponding unit test test_create_event. 

### What are the pros and cons of TDD?
  Among many different pros of TDD, one of the key pros of TDD is that it helps in identifying and fixing bugs early in the development process, which can significantly reduce the cost and effort of bug fixing later in the project and also promotes writing clean and maintainable code.
Even though TDD brings more good than bad, one of the cons of TDD is that sometimes writing tests before the code can feel like an overhead, especially for small or simple projects. It may be seen as unnecessary for trivial or experimental code. Moreover, maintaining a suite of tests can be time-consuming and may require effort, especially as the codebase evolves.
